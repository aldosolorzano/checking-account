# checking-account

A checking account from a bank allows for putting (deposits, salaries, credits)
or taking (purchases, withdrawals, debits) money at any given time.

You can also check what is your current balance or your account statement,
containing all operations that happened between two dates, along with the
account's daily balance.
## Solution
I decided to store accounts in a nested map to be flexible with account numbers, each account contains a vector atom that keeps record of the transactions done by the account.

Transactions are a vector of maps contain the corresponding information.

Both accounts and transactions are atoms to ensure it can run in a concurrent-safe way. To keep the next tx-id or account id, I created 2 global atoms contain each of the id's.

Every time a new account is created the atom is increased by one using swap to secure it from other threads. Also the new-tx-id is added to the account tx-ids atom, this transactions are done with a dosync too preserve same information and if one of them fails nothing is added to the data structure.
## Dependencies
Clojure 1.10.0
